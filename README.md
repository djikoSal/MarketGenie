# MarketGenie
This is part of an course in id1214 in KTH. 

Project goal: 
  Webscraping in order to obtain data. What kind of data? Two types of data that we will try to find a correlation between.
  
  Data type 1: 
                Market Data - This is the "real data", this should be preferably obtained through an api instead of scraping
  Data type 2: 
                Test Data - This is the data we want to test it against to find correlations.
